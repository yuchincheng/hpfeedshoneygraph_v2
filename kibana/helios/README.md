#HeliosJS  
HeliosJS is an in-memory graph database for modern browsers. It employs a non-blocking asynchronous architecture through the use of Promises and Web Workers. This enables HeliosJS to download and process large data sets without blocking the UI.


In order to traverse the graph, HeliosJS uses a [Gremlin](http://gremlin.tinkerpop.com) inspired graph traversal language to query, analyze and manipulate the graph. Gremlin is an open source project maintained by [TinkerPop](http://tinkerpop.com). For more information on Gremlin, see the [Gremlin wiki](https://github.com/tinkerpop/gremlin/wiki).

__Please see the [website](http://entrendipity.github.com/helios.js/) for full documentation.__
